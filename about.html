        Founder of LikelyThis, Brian Bacon, is a higher education professional with 15+ years of experience, especially in the world of "transfer."  LikelyThis is based upon extensive transfer research combined with collegiate experience.  Those looking to transfer however should follow this advice: don't do this in isolation.  Course transferability is most likely successful when students connect early and often with their guidance counselors, advisors, and admissions representatives.
