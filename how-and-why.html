            <h1>Why is a class Likely or Unlikely to transfer?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>For any college degree, such as an Associate‚Äôs or Bachelor‚Äôs program, consider that general education
                courses make up roughly one-third of your degree. The other two-thirds? This is where you have some core
                requirements specific to your major, e.g., Engineering, Business, etc. This is also where electives
                enter the picture, as well as some fine-tuning for your major. </p>
            <p>We know that these terms may be familiar to some and unfamiliar to others. LikelyThis is based upon a
                simple concept: are your courses mostly found in general education categories or major core
                requirements?</p>
            <p>If the answer to this is yes, your class is Likely to transfer. Specifically, colleges and universities
                typically are willing to accept this kind of credit for transfer as opposed to upper-level courses deep
                into your major that are normally desired and reserved for the institution where you eventually want to
                complete your degree. </p>

            <p> A word or two of caution: ensure that the credit you‚Äôre looking to transfer is from an accredited
                college or university. How to tell? We like to reference the Council for Higher Education Accreditation
                (CHEA). Also, if you‚Äôre attending a community college or taking community college credit as a high
                school student, we recommend that you stick to a class or classes designed for transfer, where this is
                typically found in an Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree. </p>
            <br>

            <h3>General Education Requirement v. Major Requirements v. General Elective Credit</h3>

            <h2>General education classes.</h2>
            <p>Gen Ed classes are requirements not necessarily part of your major, e.g., Business, that you need in
                order to earn an associate degree and/or bachelor degree from any accredited college/university.</p>
            <p>Examples of gen eds include Freshman Composition, Introduction to Psychology, etc. General Education
                requirements typically represent roughly 12- 14 courses (about 36 semester credit hours), or about
                one-third of your bachelor‚Äôs degree.</p>
            <p>For a typical transfer associate degree, e.g., AA or AS, this is about two-thirds of your 2-yr program.
            </p>

            <h2>Major Requirements.</h2>
            <p>While your general education requirements make up about one-third of your bachelor‚Äôs degree, your major
                requirements will represent at least about another one-third of your bachelor‚Äôs degree, roughly a
                minimum of 12 semester credit hours.</p>
            <p>Examples of these classes? Any 300-400 level courses: Thermodynamics; Advanced Financial Accounting.
                There are transfer opportunities, here, however, where we suggest taking about six to seven ‚Äúmajor core
                requirements‚Äù while at your community college or university.</p>
            <p>Examples of these classes? Look for things like Principles of Managerial Accounting, Statics, Dynamics,
                Abnormal Psychology, etc. ‚ÄúMajor core requirements‚Äù refers to course requirements for a particular
                college, e.g., College of Business, regardless of specific major, e.g., Accounting or Finance. </p>

            <h2>General Electives.</h2>
            <p>Electives typically represent whatever is left to satisfy your Bachelor degree requirements (120 semester
                credit hours typical for a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree), often about seven or eight courses (about 20ish semester
                credit hours). </p>
            <p>For any given institution, elective courses can be completely up to the discretion of the student so long
                as they are in the general field of study declared, e.g., any Business class of choice for a Business
                major. </p>
            <p>The distinction here? These specific elective courses are not prescribed by the college but rather afford
                the student some freedom in selecting based upon interest. </p>
            <p>For transfer purposes, this is a friendly category in which to apply credit, where if a
                college/university does not have an exact equivalent of a transfer course within the major, they might
                assign the said course to this elective category to still count towards the 120ish credit hour
                requirements for the Bachelor‚Äôs degree. </p>

            <h3>High School Students</h3>

            <h2>LikelyThis‚Ñ¢ Considerations for High School Students:</h2>
            <p>‚ÄúHigh School students - are you trying to get a jumpstart on your college journey? AP Credit? Dual Credit
                at your high school or credit taken directly at your community college?</p>
            <p>This is certainly typical. For this reason, LikelyThis‚Ñ¢ also factors in your AP Courses, as well as that
                Dual Credit/Community College course work. </p>
            <p>This is fraught with nuances, however, such as your particular AP Test Score, or if that community
                college credit is considered ‚Äútransfer-friendly.‚Äù </p>

            <p>What if you‚Äôre undecided on where to attend college, or for what major? LikelyThis‚Ñ¢ has included some
                resources and encourages you to check them out early and often. </p>
            <p>As with all of our suggestions, make sure that you don‚Äôt do this in isolation. Always connect with your
                Guidance Counselors and College Admissions representatives. </p>
            <p>You may also find it helpful to consult with an Independent Education Consultant but be wary, this often
                comes with a hefty price tag.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CommonApp</li>
                <li>CoalitionApp</li>
                <p>Two popular and seamless application tools, CommonApp and CoalitionApp contain resources and
                    considerations for your college search.
                    Additionally, they make it easy to apply to a multitude of colleges/universities (highly recommended
                    by the way).
                    LikelyThis‚Ñ¢ encourages college applicants to apply to at least five colleges, preferably early in
                    your senior year of high school, i.e., by November 1.</p>
                <li>ARWU</li>
                <p>We confess that we have a bias against any college ranking systems but understand the draw to consult
                    these types of lists.
                    In general, we like the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), as this trends towards a
                    specific methodology in their approach. </p>
                <li>CampusReel.org</li>
                <p>Whatever you do, make sure you visit colleges of interest, preferably in an official capacity where
                    you schedule this through an Admissions Office.
                    This isn‚Äôt always doable, however, especially if you are trying to visit several or a dozen
                    campuses; in which case, virtual is the way to go and LikelyThis‚Ñ¢ is partial to the student
                    narrative showcased through CampusReel.org. </p>

                Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU)
                Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)
                <p>Did you know that students who attend HSI‚Äôs (Hispanic Serving Institutions) and HBCU‚Äôs (Historically
                    Black Colleges and Universities) tend to have greater academic success rates than if those same
                    students went to a non-Minority Serving Institution (MSI)? </p>
                Don‚Äôt take our word for it, check out another great resource, UNCF.org. </p>
                <li>Bold.org</li>
                <p>Partners of LikelyThis.xyz, LLC‚Ñ¢, Bold.org boasts a robust array of scholarships for students to
                    pursue. </p>
                <li>AP Credit</li>
                <P>Probably the most friendly ‚Äúearly college‚Äù approach to getting ahead while in high school, ensure
                    that you are researching how your targeted colleges accept these credits and note that there is not
                    a universal approach here: each college is different as to how they accept AP Credit.
                    <li>ACT/SAT and Test-Optional or Test-Blind</li>
                <p>More and more colleges are becoming test-optional, meaning that they don‚Äôt require submission of the
                    ACT/SAT. Our suggestion?
                    Still submit these test scores for consideration when applying, as this might be the difference
                    between acceptance and denial.
                    Note that some schools, however, are going ‚Äútest blind,‚Äù meaning that they will not look at the
                    ACT/SAT even if it‚Äôs submitted. We like this and hope that this becomes a trend. </p>
                <li>Independent Education Consultants</li>
                <p>Are you seeking outside professional assistance to your college search?
                    This isn‚Äôt a bad idea but be mindful of the expense typically associated with Independent Education
                    Consultants.
                    Also, bear in mind that these consultants often come from a background as Admissions Counselors and
                    Guidance Counselors, these are the very people you have access to anyway, and they‚Äôre free to
                    connect with at your convenience. </p>
                <li>Dual Credit and Concurrent Enrollment</li>
                <p>Aside from the AP approach, consider Dual Credit and Concurrent Enrollment possibilities, which allow
                    you local college credit from your community college.
                    This can help jumpstart your college career but make sure to look into how these credits will work
                    for you when moving forward, as they are often rather career-specific, e.g., Nursing. </p>

            <h2>Brian‚Äôs/LikelyThis Considerations for Community College Students</h2>
            <p>‚ÄúCommunity College students - what are you looking for in a transfer destination? At LikelyThis‚Ñ¢ we enjoy
                simplicity.
                For instance, simply, write on a blank sheet of paper at least five to seven priorities for you when
                looking at your next destination, e.g., distance of college from home, size of school, price, etc.
                We recommend doing this exercise each semester you‚Äôre at your community college. </p>

            <p> LikelyThis‚Ñ¢ has included some resources and encourages you to check them out early (today isn‚Äôt a bad
                time to start :)) and often.
                As with all of our suggestions, make sure that you don‚Äôt do this in isolation. Always connect with your
                Academic Advisor and Admissions Representatives for guidance.
                Also, remember to apply early for financial aid (fafsa.ed.gov), typically October for those in the fall
                semester looking at an upcoming fall semester for transfer.
                For applying? Do not apply to just one college! Look to apply to several (5-7) colleges and do this by
                February for those looking at fall admission, or October for those looking at spring admission. </p>

            <h2>Brian‚Äôs/LikelyThis Considerations for 4-yr College Students</h2>
            <p>‚Äú4yr college students - what are you looking for in a transfer destination? At LikelyThis‚Ñ¢ we enjoy
                simplicity.
                For instance, simply, write on a blank sheet of paper at least five to seven priorities for you when
                looking at your next destination, e.g., distance of college from home, size of school, price, etc. Also,
                have you transferred more than once?
                Be wary of the number of times you transfer. If this looks like going from one 4yr college to another
                4yr college to another 4yr college‚Ä¶ this is too much and we‚Äôd caution you of wasted transfer credit and
                potential financial aid limitations. </p>
