The other two-thirds?  This is where you have some core requirements specific to your major, e.g., Engineering, Business, etc.  This is also where electives enter the picture, as well as some fine-tuning for your major. 
                                                    We know that these terms may be familiar to some and unfamiliar to others.  LikelyThis™ is based upon a simple concept: are your courses mostly found in general education categories or major core requirements?  If the answer to this is yes, your class is Likely to transfer.  Specifically, colleges and universities typically are willing to accept this kind of credit for transfer as opposed to upper-level courses deep into your major that are normally desired and reserved for the institution where you eventually want to complete your degree.

                                                <li>A word or two of caution: ensure that the credit you’re looking to transfer is from an accredited college or university.  How to tell? We like to reference the <a href="https://www.chea.org/" target="_blank" >Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). </a> Also, if you’re attending a community college or taking community college credit as a high school student, we recommend that you stick to a class or classes designed for transfer, where this is typically found in an Associate in Arts or Associate in Science degree.

                                <h4>General Education Requirement v. Major Requirements v. General Elective Credit </h4>
                                <p><strong>General education classes.</strong> Gen Ed classes are requirements not necessarily part of your major, e.g., Business, that you need in order to earn an associate degree and/or bachelor degree from any accredited college/university.  Examples of gen eds include Freshman Composition, Introduction to Psychology, etc.  General Education requirements typically represent roughly 12- 14 courses (about 36 semester credit hours), or about one-third of your bachelor’s degree.  For a typical transfer associate degree, e.g., AA or AS, this is about two-thirds of your 2-yr program.  
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Major Requirements.</strong>  While your general education requirements make up about one-third of your bachelor’s degree, your major requirements will represent at least about another one-third of your bachelor’s degree, roughly a minimum of 12 semester credit hours.  Examples of these classes?  Any 300-400 level courses: Thermodynamics; Advanced Financial Accounting.  There are transfer opportunities, here, however, where we suggest taking about six to seven “major core requirements” while at your community college or university.  Examples of these classes?  Look for things like Principles of Managerial Accounting, Statics, Dynamics, Abnormal Psychology, etc.  “Major core requirements” refers to course requirements for a particular college, e.g., College of Business, regardless of specific major, e.g., Accounting or Finance. 
                                    <p><strong>General Electives. </strong> Electives typically represent whatever is left to satisfy your Bachelor degree requirements (120 semester credit hours typical for a Bachelor’s Degree), often about seven or eight courses (about 20ish semester credit hours).  For any given institution, elective courses can be completely up to the discretion of the student so long as they are in the general field of study declared, e.g., any Business class of choice for a Business major.  The distinction here?  These specific elective courses are not prescribed by the college but rather afford the student some freedom in selecting based upon interest.  For transfer purposes, this is a friendly category in which to apply credit, where if a college/university does not have an exact equivalent of a transfer course within the major, they might assign the said course to this elective category to still count towards the 120ish credit hour requirements for the Bachelor’s degree.  </p>

                        <p> Feeling undecided on where to attend college?  What major to choose?  What are you looking for in a college destination? At LikelyThis™ we enjoy simplicity.  For instance, simply, write on a blank sheet of paper at least five to seven priorities for you when looking at your next destination, e.g., distance of college from home, size of school, price, etc.  We recommend doing this early and often (like every couple of months) to help in your decision making.  </p>
                        <p>For a major, remember this: it is rare that a major limits you to one particular career (exceptions are in the case of nursing or teaching).  Over time, there is compelling evidence that those who major in fields of study like Philosophy, Japanese, etc. tend to earn the same average salary as those in more vocational fields, e.g., Business. One exercise, however, to help with your major selection: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Select a particular college versus major, e.g., College of Health Sciences or College of Business or College of Engineering?  </li>
                            <li>2. Once a college is selected, e.g., College of Business, choose courses that meet core requirements.  Example, a College of Engineering will require a Calculus sequence regardless if you’re interested in Electrical Engineering or Chemical Engineering, etc.  </li>
                            <li>3. Take classes in things that interest you but do this in collaboration with a guidance counselor, academic advisor, or admissions counselor.  </li>
                            <li>4. Absolutely visit a college or university (ideally several) and do this through official channels, i.e., Admissions Office.  Additionally, be sure to inquire if you can meet one-on-one with a faculty member in the field of study that interests you to help in your decision making.  This could also include a tour of a college or department in the area(s) of interest, e.g., College of Business. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>LikelyThis™  Considerations for High School Students: </h4>

                        <p>“High School students - are you trying to get a jumpstart on your college journey?  AP Credit?  Dual Credit at your high school or credit taken directly at your community college?  This is certainly typical.  For this reason, LikelyThis™ also factors in your AP Courses, as well as that Dual Credit/Community College course work.  This is fraught with nuances, however, such as your particular AP Test Score, or if that community college credit is considered “transfer-friendly.”  </p>
                        <p>What if you’re undecided on where to attend college, or for what major?  LikelyThis™  has included some resources and encourages you to check them out early and often.  As with all of our suggestions, make sure that you don’t do this in isolation.  Always connect with your Guidance Counselors and College Admissions representatives.  You may also find it helpful to consult with an <a href="http://www.iecaonline.com" target="_blank">Independent Education Consultant</a> but be wary, this often comes with a hefty price tag.</p>

Don’t take our word for it, check out another great resource, UNCF.org.  </p>

                            <li>Ap Credit</li>
                            <p>Probably the most friendly “early college” approach to getting ahead while in high school, ensure that you are researching how your targeted colleges accept these credits and note that there is not a universal approach here: each college is different as to how they accept AP Credit.   </p>
                            <li>ACT/SAT and Test-Optional or Test-Blind</li>
                            <p>More and more colleges are becoming test-optional, meaning that they don’t require submission of the ACT/SAT.  Our suggestion?  Still submit these test scores for consideration when applying, as this might be the difference between acceptance and denial.  Note that some schools, however, are going “test blind,” meaning that they will not look at the ACT/SAT even if it’s submitted.  We like this and hope that this becomes a trend.                              </p>
                            <li>Independent Education Consultants</li>
                            <p>Are you seeking outside professional assistance to your college search?  This isn’t a bad idea but be mindful of the expense typically associated with Independent Education Consultants.  Also, bear in mind that these consultants often come from a background as Admissions Counselors and Guidance Counselors, these are the very people you have access to anyway, and they’re free to connect with at your convenience.</p>
                            <li>Dual Credit and Concurrent Enrollment</li>
                            <p>Aside from the AP approach, consider Dual Credit and Concurrent Enrollment possibilities, which allow you local college credit from your community college.  This can help jumpstart your college career but make sure to look into how these credits will work for you when moving forward, as they are often rather career-specific, e.g., Nursing.</p>

                                      <p> -Submit your college applications to at least 5 colleges.  We recommend asking these college admissions representatives if they can waive your application fee - this can get pricey to apply to so many colleges but schools are often willing to waive the application fee, especially if you apply early.</p>
                                      <p>- Have you submitted your FAFSA yet? FAFSA.ed.gov.</p>
                                      <p>- Investigate and apply to as many scholarships as possible.  This information can typically be found on a college admissions website but also through outside resources such as LikelyThis.xyz and Bold.org.</p>

                                      <p>- Visit your top two or three colleges again.</p>
                                      <p>- This is often when you will receive your financial aid award to know what your cost will actually be to attend. NOTE: Apply to a school even if it seems out of reach financially, as you won’t truly know your out-of-pocket estimated expense until your financial aid award comes through.  </p>
                                      <p>- Have you received an evaluation of your college credit?  If not, time to ask this of your college admissions counselor(s). </p>

                                      <p>- May 1 is typically when deposits are due, AKA, when you need to decide where you’re going to attend.</p>
                                      <p>- Submit your final official college transcripts for any pending classes taken that have recently ended.</p>
                                      <p>- Do you have any other lingering credit, transcripts?  Consider any prior AP Test Scores, High School Dual Credit, as well as IB exam results.</p>
                                      <p>- Are you eligible for the Honors Program at your next school?  We highly recommend pursuing this option if applicable, typically requiring a 3.5 cumulative grade point average for admission.  </p>
